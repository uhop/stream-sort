`stream-sort` is a procedure to sort streams of objects far exceeding available memory. The only assumption is that as little as four objects can fit in memory. The algorithm has O(N * log N) complexity, and as efficient as a quick sort.

## Introduction

The simplest example (streaming from a file):

```js
// TBD
```

## Installation

```
npm install stream-sort
```
